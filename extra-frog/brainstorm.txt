brainstorming for Extra frog

Armor and weapons

-Diamond armor from minecraft - level 5 protection

-Particular Helmet (PMushy cap) - level 8 protection

-kamella wand from SMG - level 3 attack

-Sack Slap from LBP, its a hand that slaps - level 5 attack

-Toggle Slap from LBP, a thicc boi slaps harder - level 10 attack

-MTGA Angel Armor - Level 10 protection


Math calcs

add all armor together, like diamond armor with a particular helmet is 23, get random between 0 and your armor+opponents armor, if in your sector you get hurt, otherwise they do
but then weapons have no purpose
maybe they deal with boss help
