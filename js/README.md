*mostly for eclipse-5214*

the banners are versions of the remove banner bookmarklet

version 1 removes the visual banner

version 2 deletes the whole banner (or all banners if you have more than one)

version 3 deletes the banner anchor div and a similar div called chat anchor that i'm nervous about
