<h2 class="headline">About JSON Presentations</h2>
<p>
	This is a thing I made because I like to make slideshows, and after I discovered that<br>
	P5.js has a function to easily convert JSON files into JavaScript objects, I knew what to make.<br>
	<br>
	You can easily make and edit scripts and present them using the tools in the program.<br>
	You can add text, video, images, and more to the slides and make their backgrounds colors,<br>
	images, and videos.<br>
	<br>
	Nothing you upload is given to me in any way because I don't want it to, (I really need to organize some folders), and also I<br>
	don't have enough server hardware to do it.
